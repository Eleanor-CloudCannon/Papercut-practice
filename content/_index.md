      PaperCut Grows is our sustainability program that transforms your
      essential documents into Forest Positive printing.


      Available with our flagship solutions PaperCut MF and PaperCut Hive, this
      easy-to-use in-product tool converts your documents printed into trees
      planted via a small up-front investment per printer.


      We’re the experts on the print side of things, we leave the actual tree
      planting to our non-profit reforestation partners around the globe.

    subtitle: How does PaperCut Grows work?
    text: >-
      We leverage our industry-leading expertise to estimate your business
      printing up front.


      Before you even press print, we calculate how many pieces of paper your
      printing uses. We then convert that into a figure of trees to plant.


      Our non-profit tree planting partners then plant your trees in a global
      reforestation tree planting project hand-picked by you.


      You then print knowing that all those print jobs aren’t a deficit on the
      planet, because you’ve already invested in an environmental surplus with
      Forest Positive printing.


      Then once you approach your original investment, it’s time to reinvest and
      purchase more trees to stay Forest Positive.
